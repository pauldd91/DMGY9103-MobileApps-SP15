Revision of initial [Movie Buddy Idea](https://github.com/pauldd91/DMGY9103-MobileApps-SP15/blob/master/textbook_work/paul_dariye/homework/app_ideas/movie_buddy.md)

The pivot or change is due to the number of conversations I had with potential users. Most were likely to use an app that let's them know about free or discounted movie screenings around the city as opposed meeting/making new friends/acquiantance through movies.
